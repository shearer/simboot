Title: Simultaneous Inference for Diversity Indices
Version: 0.2-7
Date: 2024-02-09
Author: Ralph Scherer, Philip Pallmann
Maintainer: Ralph Scherer <shearer.ra76@gmail.com>
Description: Provides estimation of simultaneous bootstrap and asymptotic confidence intervals for diversity indices, namely the Shannon and the Simpson index. Several pre--specified multiple comparison types are available to choose. Further user--defined contrast matrices are applicable. In addition, simboot estimates adjusted as well as unadjusted p--values for two of the three proposed bootstrap methods. Further simboot allows for comparing biological diversities of two or more groups while simultaneously testing a user-defined selection of Hill numbers of orders q, which are considered as appropriate and useful indices for measuring diversity.
